            A simple diagram showing a toggle switch with two positions: OFF and ON. The arrow labeled 'tap' indicates that pressing or tapping on either position will change it to its opposite state.

                In the diagram, the two circles, named off and on, represent the state of the light. The state of the light can be changed by the occurrence of an event, named tap. We show a transition from one state to another by a directed arc (A line with an arrow on one end) from one state to another, labelled with the name of an event. There is a special transition, shown as a “lightning-strike”, that indicates the starting state of the diagram. (In this example, the starting state is named off.) A diagram such as this is called a finite state machine(FSM).

                This state-diagram very neatly and succinctly captures the behavior of the light: Initially, the light is off, and the FSM is in state off. Upon receipt of a tap event, the system changes state to on, indicating that the light is now on. The FSM is now in state on. Upon receipt of a tap event, the system changes state to off, indicating that the light is now off. The FSM is now in state off.

                We can show the current state by putting a dot inside it. For example, immediately after starting this FSM, the diagram will appear as shown in fig. 2.

            A simple diagram showing a switch with two positions: OFF and ON. The switch is depicted as having an 'OFF' position on one side, indicated by a circle with a black dot inside it, and an 'ON' position on the other side, marked by text within a circular boundary. Arrows indicate that to change from 'OFF' to 'ON', or vice versa, requires pressing down (tap) in both directions.

                All this behaviour can be understood just by putting your finger on the current state (the one with the dot) and, upon receipt of an event, following the appropriate transition to the next state. By reading the diagram, it is easy to see what will happen in every situation.

                Consider our previous diagram, with the tap-light in the _OFF_ state. If we receive a _tap_ event, the diagram changes to the _ON_ state, as shown in fig. 3.

            A simple diagram showing a switch with two states: OFF and ON. The OFF state is connected to an arrow labeled 'OFF' pointing upwards, indicating that it can be turned on by tapping once (tap). Similarly, the ON state has an arrow labeled 'ON' pointing downwards, suggesting that it can also be turned off by another tap.
