            An NFA is often easier to construct than a DFA for a given language, which is sufficient justification for studying NFAs. You may be surprised to know that every NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA, so it is always possible to implement an NFA.

In the worst case, an NFA with n states will require a DFA with 2ⁿ — 1 states. Fortunately, this case arises only rarely in practice, and a typical DFA has about the same number of states as the original NFA.

We can construct a DFA from an NFA by first creating all the non-empty subsets of the states of the NFA (there will be 2ⁿ — 1 such subsets, for an NFA with n states). Let us call each subset a d-state. We then build a DFA with a separate state for each d-state.

The goal is to take an NFA N = (Qₙ, Σ, δᵢ, Q₀ₙ, Fₙ) and generate a corresponding DFA D = (Q₀, Σ, δ₀, Q₀₀, F₀) such that L(N) = L(D).

We notice that the two automata have the same input alphabet, Σ, and the initial state of D (q₀₀) is the d-state containing all the initial states of N (Q₀ₙ). The remaining parts of the automaton D can be constructed as follows:

            * Q_D is the set of all non-empty subsets of Q_N. We refer to each of these as a d-state_. Since Q_N has n states, there will be 2^n subsets. After eliminating the empty subset, Q_D will have 2^n-1 d-states. Fortunately, in practical cases, many of these d-states will be unreachable from the initial d-state, and so can be thrown away. This can substantially reduce the complexity of the final DFA.

            * The final-set of D (=F_D), is the set of d-states in Q_D, such that each d-state contains at least one accepting state of N. We can specify this as:

            * For each d-state d in Q_D, and for each symbol t in Σ, we can define δ_D(d,t) by looking at each of the corresponding NFA states s∈ d, and then seeing how N would handle each of those states for an input symbol t. Then we compute the union of those states, to get the actual d-state. Formally:

            Taking our example of the zeroOne NFA, we have: Qn = q0, q1, q2. Now Qp is the set of all non-empty subsets of Qn, thus the d-states in Qp will be: q0, q1, q2, q0, q1, q0, q2, q1, q2, and q0, q1, q2. We can write:

            Q_D={{q_0},{q_1},{q_2},{q_0,q_1},{q_0,q_2},{q_1,q_2},{q_0,q_1,q_2}}
            </formula>

            Since N has 3 states, there are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-empty subsets, as we have just seen.

            The final states of the DFA are q₂, q₀, q₂, q₁, q₂, and q₀, q₁, q₂, since these d-states all include the final state q₂ of the original NFA. When we construct the transition function, we find:
