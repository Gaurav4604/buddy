            The extended transition function, Δ allows us to specify how an NFA in state-set Q will move to state-set R upon receipt of a symbol s. We show this by writing R = Δ(Q, s).

We are interested in knowing what state-set an NFA will reach, starting at Q₀, if it is presented with a string of symbols w = s₁s₂s₃⋯sₙ.

We can specify Δ, the string transition function, that takes a current state-set P and a string of input symbols v = s₁s₂s₃⋯sₙ, and generates the state-set R that the NFA will reach after processing those symbols: R = Δ̂(P, w), like this:

The extended transition function, A allows us to specify how an NFA in state-set Q will move to state-set R upon receipt of a symbol s. We show this by writing R = A(Q, s).

We are interested in knowing what state-set an NFA will reach, starting at Q₀, if it is presented with a string of symbols w = 5₁8₂5₃ — 8p.

We can specify A, the string transition function, that takes a current state-set P and a string of input symbols w = s₁s₂s₃—8, and generates the state-set R that the NFA will reach after processing those symbols: R = A(P, w), like this:

            Note that Q is a _set of sets of states_ – the set of all subsets that can be created by selecting states from Q.

We can define Δ̂ recursively, like this:

            Base case If there is no input, the NFA stays in the current state-set, P. Thus the rule is:

            Δ̂(P, ϵ) = P

            **Recurrence case**] If we are given a string of symbols s₁s₂s₃⋯sₙ, we 'chop' the first symbol s₁ from the string, and use Δ to compute the state-set, T, that would be reached, starting at each state p in P:

    T = Δ(P, s_1)

            </formula>
            

            <text>
            We then use the Δ̂ function to process the remainder of the string, starting at T: Δ̂(T, ∘_2∘_3⋯∘_n). Combining the pieces, we get:

We then use the A function to process the remainder of the string, starting at T: A(T, 5283 — Sn).

            <formula>
            Δ̂(P, s_1s_2s_3⋯ s_n) = Δ̂(Δ(P, s_1)), s_2s_3⋯ s_n)
            </formula>
            

            <text>
            We can see that a recursive evaluation according to these rules must terminate in a finite number of steps, because each recursive invocation of δ̂ occurs with a shorter string of symbols. Eventually, we will reach the base case: Δ̂(R, ϵ).

            Note that we must define the acceptance test slightly differently from a DFA. In a DFA, the δ̂ function returns a single state, and we check to see if that state is in F. For an NFA, Δ̂ returns a set of states. If one or more of those states is in F, then the NFA is in an accepting state. We express this condition by computing the intersection between the result of Δ̂ and F, Δ̂(⋯)∩ F. If the intersection is non-null, we know that the NFA has reached an accepting state.
