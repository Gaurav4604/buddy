            When we process the input symbol 0, there are two cases to handle: There is no outgoing transition from state q_1, so it is unable to handle the 0. State q_0 has two outgoing transitions labelled with 0, so the NFA enters states q_0 and q_1. The overall effect is for the NFA diagram to not change:

        A diagram showing a finite state machine with three states: q0, q1, and q2. The initial state is q0, which has two transitions to q1 (one on input 0 and one on input 1). From q1, there is a transition to q2 only when the input is 1.

            To process the input symbol 1, we again must handle two cases. The dot in q₀ results in the next state being q₀. The dot in q₁ results in the next state being q₂. There are two current states q₀ and q₂, and the diagram now looks like this:

            Since q₂ is an accepting state, the NFA has recognized a string that ends in 01.

            A non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) consists of:


    eginalign*	ext1. A finite set  S 	ext of states.
    	ext2. A finite input alphabet Σ.
    	ext3. A transition function δ: S ×Σ→ P(S).
    	ext4. A start state  q_0 	ext in  S.
    	ext5. A set  F 	ext of final states, where  F ⊆ S.

            1. A finite set of _states_, usually denoted by Q
2. A finite set of _input symbols_, usually denoted by ™.
3. A transition function δ: Q × Σ → Q, that takes a state and an input symbol, and returns a set of new states. The transition function is usually denoted by δ.
4. A set of start-states Q₀ ⊆ Q, Q₀ is a set containing one or more of the states in Q.
5. A set of final or accepting states F' ⊆ Q, usually denoted by F’. Clearly, F’ is a subset of Q.

            Notice that the there are two minor differences between a DFA and an NFA. The first difference is that the transition function for a DFA returns a single state, whereas for an NFA it returns a set of states.

The second difference follows from the first, and is that a DFA has a single start state, whereas an NFA has a set of start states.

A non-deterministic finite automaton named N can be represented by a 5-tuple:

            <text>
            where Q is the set of states, Σ is the set of input symbols, δ is the transition function, Q₀ is the set of initial states, and F is the set of final states.
