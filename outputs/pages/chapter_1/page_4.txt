            Not surprisingly, we can represent the transition function for our example in tabular form, like this:
            </text>
            

                <table>
                
<headers>
    ['zeroOne', 'delta', '0', '1']
</headers>
<rows>
        <row>['→ q₀', '{q₀, q₁}', '⁀', '{q₀}']</row>
	<row>['q₁', '⁀', '⁀', '{q₂}']</row>
	<row>['*q₂', '⁀', '⁀', '⁀']</row>
</rows>
        
                </table>
                

                <table>
                
<headers>
    ['zeroOne', 'delta', '0', '1']
</headers>
<rows>
        <row>['→ q₀', '{q₀, q₁}', '⁀', '{q₀}']</row>
	<row>['q₁', '⁀', '⁀', '{q₂}']</row>
	<row>['*q₂', '⁀', '⁀', '⁀']</row>
</rows>
        
                </table>
                

            <text>
            The only difference between this table and the one for a DFA is that the _next-state_ entries in the table are a _set_ of states, instead of being a single state. For example, the entry for state q_0 given the symbol 0 is the set {q_0,q_1}. When there is no next state, we show the next state as an empty set, ∅.

# 2.3.1   The extended transition function, Delta

            <text>
            An NER can simultaneously be in multiple states but, by convention, the transition function, δ, is specified in terms of a _single_ state and _single_ symbol, and returns a _set_ of states. We will find it convenient to define a new function Δ that accepts as parameters a _set_ of states, and a symbol, and returns a _set_ of states.

If an NFA is in the set of states P, and receives an input symbol s, then the next state is determined by evaluating _delta_ for each state in that set (which will return a _set_ of states), and then computing the union of those sets.

Formally:

            <formula>
            Δ(P, s) = ⋃_p ∈ Pδ(p, s)
            </formula>

# 2.3.2   Extending the transition function to strings

            To understand how an NFA decides whether to "accept" a string of symbols, we need to see how it processes a string. The set of all strings that an NFA accepts is called its "language".

Suppose β_1⊗β_2⋯⊗_n is a sequence of input symbols drawn from Σ, (the set of input symbols that this NFA can process).

We start with the NFA in its initial state-set, R_0=Q_0, and use the extended transition function Δ to process the first input symbol to get the next the next state-set:
            </text>
            

            <formula>
            
    R_1 = Δ(R_0, s_1)

            </formula>
            

            <text>
            R_1 is the set of new states that the NFA enters after receiving the input symbol s_1. We now take this state-set, and process the next symbol s_2, to find the next state-set, R_2:
            </text>
            

            <formula>
            
    R_o = A(R_i, s_2)

            </formula>
            

            <text>
            Continuing in this manner until all input symbols have been processed, we successively enter sets of states R_3,R_4,…,R_n. At each step,
            </text>
            

            <formula>
            
    R_i = Δ(R_i-1, s_i)

            </formula>
            

            <text>
            If one of the states in R_n is an accepting state (i.e. if R_n∩ F≠∅), then the string of input symbols s_1s_2s_3⋯ s_n is "accepted". If not, it is "rejected".
