            <text>
            An _alphabet_ is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is conventional to use the Greek letter Σ (sigma), to represent an alphabet. Some examples of common alphabets are:

            <text>
            1. Σ={0,1}, the set of binary digits.
2. Σ={A,B,⋯,Z}, the set of Roman letters.
3. Σ={N,E,S,W}, the set of compass-points.

            A string is a finite sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet. A string is also sometimes called a word. Some examples of strings are:

            1. 100101 is a string from the binary alphabet Σ={0,1}.
2. THEORY is a string from the Roman alphabet Σ={A,B,⋯,Z}.
3. SE is a string from the compass-points alphabet Σ={N,E,S,W}.

            <text>
            The *empty string* is a string with no symbols in it, usually denoted by the Greek letter ϵ (epsilon). Clearly, the empty string is a string that can be chosen from any alphabet.

            It is handy to classify strings by their _length_, the number of symbols in the string. The string THEORY, for example, has a length of 6. The usual notation for the length of a string s is |s|. Thus |THEORY|=6, |1001|=4, and |ϵ|=0.

            We are often interested in the set of all strings of a certain length, say k, drawn from an alphabet Σ. This can be constructed by taking the _Cartesian product_, of Σ with itself k times: Σ×Σ×⋯Σ. We can represent this symbolically, using exponential notation, as Σ^k.

Clearly Σ^0={e}, for any alphabet Σ, because e is the only string whose length is zero.

For the alphabet Σ={N,E,S,W}, we find:

            <formula>
            Σ^1={N,E,S,W}

Σ^2={NN,NE,NS,NW,EN,EE,ES,EW,SN,SE,SS,SW,WN,WE,WS,WW}

Σ^3={NNN,NNE,NNS,⋯,WWS,WWW}
            </formula>
            

            <text>
            Σ^2={NN,NE,NS,NW,EN,EE,ES,EW,SN,SE,SS,SW,WN,WE,WS,WW}. 
            </text>
            

            <formula>
            Σ^3 = {NNN, NNE, NNS, …, WWS, WWW}

            Σ^3, has 64 members, since it contains 4×4×4 members.

The set of _all_ strings that can be drawn from an alphabet is conventionally denoted, using the so-called _Kleene star_, by Σ^*, and of course has an infinite number of members. For the alphabet Σ={0,1}
