                An _alphabet_ is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is conventional to use the Greek letter Σ (sigma), to represent an alphabet. Some examples of common alphabets are:

                A _string_ is a finite sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet. A string is also sometimes called a *word*. Some examples of strings are:

                The *empty string* is a string with no symbols in it, usually denoted by the Greek letter ϵ (epsilon). Clearly, the empty string is a string that can be chosen from any alphabet.

                It is handy to classify strings by their length, the number of symbols in the string. The string THEORY, for example, has a length of 6. The usual notation for the length of a string s is |s|. Thus |THEORY| = 6, |1001| = 4, and |e| = 0.

                We are often interested in the set of all strings of a certain length, say k, drawn from an alphabet Σ. This can be constructed by taking the Cartesian product, of Σ with itself k times: Σ×Σ×⋯Σ. We can represent this symbolically, using exponential notation, as Σ^k.
