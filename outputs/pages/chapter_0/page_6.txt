            Sometimes we do not want to include the empty string in the set. The set of _non-empty_ strings is denoted by Σ^+. This is often referred to as the _Kleene plus_, by analogy with the Kleene star.

            Let s be the string composed of the m symbols s_1s_1s_2⋯ s_m, and t be the string composed of the n symbols t_1t_1t_2⋯ t_n. The _concatenation_ of the strings s and t, denoted by st, is the string of length m+n, composed of the symbols s_1s_2s_2⋯ s_mt_1t_1t_2⋯ t_n.

It is clear that the string ϵ can be concatenated with any other string s and that: ϵ s=sϵ=s, ϵ thus behaves as the _identity value_, for concatenation.

            A set of strings, all of which have been chosen from Σ^* of an alphabet Σ, is called a _language_. If Σ is an alphabet, and L⊆Σ^*, then L is said to be a _language over Σ_.

Al language over Σ does not need to include strings with all the symbols of Σ. The implication of this is that when we know that L is a language over Σ, then L is also a language over any alphabet that is a _supers_ of Σ.

The use of the word "language" here is entirely consistent with everyday usage. For example the language "English" can be considered to be a set of strings drawn from the alphabet of Roman letters.

The programming language Java, or indeed any other programming language, is another example. The set of syntactically-correct programs is the set of strings that can be formed from the alphabet of the language (the ASCII characters).

Using the alphabets we defined earlier, we can specify some languages that might be of interest to us:

            1. The language consisting of valid binary byte-values (a string of 8 0's or 1's): {0000000000001,⋯,111111111} This is just Σ^5.
2. The set of even-party binary numbers (having an even number of 1's), whose first digit is a 1: {11,101,1001,1001,100,1111,⋯}
3. The set of valid compass directions: {N,S,E,W,NE,NW,SE,SW,NNE,ENE,⋯}
4. Σ^* is a language over an alphabet Σ.
5. {ϵ}, the language consisting only of the empty string, is a language over any alphabet. This language has just one string: ϵ.
6. ∅, the language with no strings, is a language over any alphabet. Note that ∅≠{ϵ}, because {ϵ} contains _one_ string.

            Notice also that an alphabet Σ is always of a finite size, but a language over that alphabet can either be of finite or of infinite size.
