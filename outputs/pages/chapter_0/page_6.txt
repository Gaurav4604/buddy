                Sometimes we do not want to include the empty string in the set. The set of non-empty strings is denoted by Σ^+. This is often referred to as the Kleene plus, by analogy with the Kleene star.

                # Concatenating strings


    Let  S = ⋃_i=1^n A_i 
           where each  A_i ⊆ X.


This process involves combining multiple sets A_1, A_2, ..., A_n into a single set S. Each subset A_i is a part of the universal set X. The union operation ensures that every element present in any of the subsets A_i is included in S, thereby creating a comprehensive set that encompasses all individual elements from each A_i.

                Let s be the string composed of the m symbols s₁s₁s₂⋯ sₘ, and t be the string composed of the n symbols t₁t₁t₂⋯ tₙ. The concatenation of the strings s and t, denoted by st, is the string of length m+n, composed of the symbols s₁s₁s₂⋯ sₘt₁t₁t₂⋯ tₙ.

                It is clear that the string ϵ can be concatenated with any other string s and that: ϵs = se = s. Thus, ϵ behaves as the identity value for concatenation.

                A set of strings, all of which have been chosen from Σ* of an alphabet Σ, is called a _language_. If Σ is an alphabet, and L⊆Σ*, then L is said to be a language over Σ.

                A language over Σ does not need to include strings with all the symbols of Σ. The implication of this is that when we know that L is a language over Σ, then L is also a language over any alphabet that is a superset of Σ.

A language over © does not need to include strings with all the symbols of ©. The implication of this is that when we know that L is a language over

                The use of the word 'language' here is entirely consistent with everyday usage. For example, the language 'English' can be considered to be a set of strings drawn from the alphabet of Roman letters.

                The programming language Java, or indeed any other programming language, is another example. The set of syntactically-correct programs is the set of strings that can be formed from the alphabet of the language (the ASCII characters).

                Using the alphabets we defined earlier, we can specify some languages that might be of interest to us:

2. The set of even-parity binary numbers (having an even number of 1’s), whose first digit is a 1: 11, 101, 110, 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111,—
3. The set of valid compass directions: N,S,E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, NNE, ENE,—
4. Σ° is a language over an alphabet Σ.
5. e, the language consisting only of the empty string, is a language over any alphabet. This language has just one string: e.
6. Q, the language with no strings, is a language over any alphabet. Note that Q ≠ e, because e contains one string.
