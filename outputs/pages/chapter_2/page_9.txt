            **Final Idea:** EvoResearchAgent: Enhancing Diversity and Novelty in Idea Generation with Evolution

* **Motivation:** Using LLMs for idea generation has shown promising advancements. However, challenges persist, particularly concerning the diversity and novelty of LLM-generated ideas. [Si et al., 2024] show that while LLMs can produce novel ideas, they often lack a broad range of perspectives and diversity. Additionally, [Bas et al., 2024] have emphasized the need for a more systematic approach to improving the quality of generated ideas. To address these issues, we propose EvoResearchAgent, a multi-agent system that leverages evolutionary algorithms to enhance the diversity and novelty of generated ideas ...

* **Method:**
    * **Idea Initialize:** An LLM generates some initial ideas as the start point of the evolutionary process .. .
    * **Metrics:** Propose automatic metrics like topic diversity and novelty to evaluate the range of ideas .. .
    * **Evolution Integration:*

            To examine the impact of the Col length on the quality of generated ideas, we constructed variants with differing maximum chain lengths. Furthermore, we also adopt the “- Col” variant in Sec. [4.2] as a 0-length variant, which uses 5 retrieved papers but does not organize them in a chain structure. Figure [6] presents the idea arena results among these length variants. We observe a substantial improvement of idea-generation quality when we increase the length from 0 to 3. This indicates a clear developmental trend analysis is more pivotal than the quantity of related literature. Furthermore, the quality of generated ideas continues to improve as the length of the Col increases. Longer Cols offer more reliable and comprehensive insights into
