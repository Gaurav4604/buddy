            Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas (Col) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the Col agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our Col agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of 0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.

            Idea generation is a crucial aspect of scientific research for driving technological innovations and breakthroughs. Traditionally, this process has been predominantly human-driven, necessitating expert researchers to review extensive literature, identify limitations in existing solutions, and propose new research directions. However, the complexity and vastness of scientific literature, coupled with rapid technological advancements, have rendered this task increasingly challenging for researchers.

            Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Achham et al. [2023], Dubey et al. [2024], Yang et al. [2024]) have enabled these models to exceed human experts in various scientific tasks, including mathematics (Yu et al. [2023]), theorem proving (Yang et al. [2023]), and coding (Chen et al. [2021]). Building on this robust scientific foundation, one may hypothesize that LLMs could support a more abstract and creative research idea-generation task. Notably, Si et al. [2024] and Kumar have contributed to this field.
