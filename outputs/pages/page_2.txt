0.5.1 Alphabets
An _alphabet_ is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is conventional to use the Greek letter Σ (sigma), to represent an alphabet. Some examples of common alphabets are:

An alphabet is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is conventional to use the Greek letter σ (sigma), to represent an alphabet. Some examples of common alphabets are:
1. Σ=0,1, the set of binary digits.
2. Σ=A,B,⋯,Z, the set of Roman letters.
3. Σ=N,E,S,W, the set of compass-points.
1. Σ=0,1, the set of binary digits.

0.5.2 Strings
A _string_ is a finite sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet. A string is also sometimes called a _word_. Some examples of strings are:

Empty string


    

The *empty string* is a string with no symbols in it, usually denoted by the Greek letter ϵ (epsilon). Clearly, the empty string is a string that can be chosen from any alphabet.
# Length of a string


    Length = √((Δ x)^2 + (Δ y)^2 + (Δ z)^2)


It is handy to classify strings by their length, the number of symbols in the string. The string THEORY, for example, has a length of 6. The usual notation for the length of a string s is |s|. Thus |THEORY| = 6, |1001| = 4, and |e| = 0.
# Powers of an alphabet

Powers of an alphabet

We are often interested in the set of all strings of a certain length, say k, drawn from an alphabet Σ. This can be constructed by taking the Cartesian product, of Σ with itself k times: Σ×Σ×⋯Σ. We can represent this symbolically, using exponential notation, as Σ^k.
early Σ^0=ϵ, for any alphabet Σ, because ϵ is the only string whose length is zero.

math: Σ^0 = {ϵ}, for any alphabet Σ, because ϵ is the only string whose length is zero.
For the alphabet Σ=N,E,S,W, we find:

For the alphabet © = N, E, S, W, we find:
Σ^1 = {N, E, S, W}
Σ^1 = {N, E, S, W}

Σ^2 = {NN, NE, NS, NW, EN, EE, ES, EW, SN, SE, SS, SW, WN, WE, WS, WW}

Σ^3 = {NNN, NNE, NNS, ⋯, WWS, WWW}
Σ^2=NN, NE, NS, NW, EN, EE, ES, EW, SN, SE, SS, SW, WN, WE, WS, WW. »? = NN, NE, NS, NW, EN, EE, ES, EW, SN, SE, SS, SW, WN, WE, WS, WW
Σ^3 = {NNN, NNE, NNS, ⋯, WWS, WWW}
Σ^3, has 64 members, since it contains 4×4×4 members.
The set of _all_ strings that can be drawn from an alphabet is conventionally denoted, using the so-called Kleene star, by Σ^*, and of course has an infinite number of members. For the alphabet Σ=0,1. The set of all strings that can be drawn from an alphabet is conventionally denoted, using the so-called Kleene star, by    *, and of course has an infinite number of members. For the alphabet x = 0,1.
Σ*=ϵ,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010,⋯

* = e,0, 1,00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, - - -
Clearly, Σ* = Σ0 ∪ Σ1 ∪ Σ2 ∪ ⋯
