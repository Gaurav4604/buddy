    Similar reasoning applies to q_1.

            <formula>
            [ eclose(q_2) ∩{q_3} ≠∅;  {q_2, q_3} ∩{q_3} ≠∅;              {q_3} ≠∅;                  true ]
            </formula>
            

            <text>
            Therefore q_2 is a final state.

            <text>
            Similar reasoning tells us that q_3 is also a final state. The final-state set is therefore: {q_2,q_3}.

        A state diagram with three states labeled q0, q1 and q2. The initial state is q0. There are two transitions from q0 to q1 and q2 respectively, both marked as +. From q1 there is a transition to q2 with probability 0..9, while the other way around has no defined probability (indicated by -). Finally, there's an edge labeled o...9 going from q2 to q3.

            As you can see, it is only slightly more complex than the original c-NFA. After a moment's examination you can also see that:

            * It is obviously a correct implementation of the original ϵ-NFA;
* State q_3 is unreachable from any state, and could be deleted; and
* Although we aimed to produce an NFA, this diagram is in fact a _DFA_. (This doesn't always happen – we just got lucky this time.)
