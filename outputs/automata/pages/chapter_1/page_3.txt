        A simple diagram showing a switch with two states: OFF and ON. The arrow labeled 'tap' indicates that pressing or tapping on either state will change it to the opposite one.

            In the diagram, the two circles, named of f and on, represent the state of the light. The state of the light can be changed by the occurrence of an event, named tap. We show a transition from one state to another by a directed arc (A line with an arrow on one end) from one state to another, labelled with the name of an event. There is a special transition, shown as a “lightning-strike”, that indicates the starting state of the diagram. (In this example, the starting state is named off.) A diagram such as this is called a finite state machine(FSM).

This state-diagram very neatly and succinctly captures the behaviour of the light: Initially, the light is off, and the FSM is in state of f. Upon receipt of a tap event, the system changes state to on, indicating that the light is now on. The FSM is now in state on. Upon receipt of a tap event, the system changes state to of f, indicating that the light is now off. The FSM is now in state of f.

We can show the current state by putting a dot inside it. For example, immediately after starting this FSM, the diagram will appear as shown in fig. 2.

        A simple diagram showing a toggle switch with an arrow indicating that it can be turned on or off. The word 'OFF' is written in bold inside one circle, and the word 'ON' is written in bold inside another circle connected by two arrows labeled 'tap'. There are also two additional arrows pointing to each of these circles from outside.

            All this behaviour can be understood just by putting your finger on the current state (the one with the dot) and, upon receipt of an event, following the appropriate transition to the next state. By reading the diagram, it is easy to see what will happen in every situation.

Consider our previous diagram, with the tap-light in the _OFF_ state. If we receive a _tap_ event, the diagram changes to the _ON_ state, as shown in fig. 3.
