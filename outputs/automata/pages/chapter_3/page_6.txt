            _repetition._ There is an additional repetition operator, +, that means "one-or-more-of". The regular expression R+ has the same meaning as RR*. We can now express our previous definition of signed integer as [+-]?[[:digit:]]+.

            _multiple_ The operator {n} (where n is a positive integer) placed after a regular expression means "n-copies-of". For example the expression (ab){3} has the same meaning as _ababab_.
