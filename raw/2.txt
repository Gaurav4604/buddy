To merge the OCR output with the LaTeX document while preserving its integrity, we can use a combination of Python scripts and LaTeX tools. Here's an updated version of your LaTeX code that incorporates the image data and text-based representation of the diagram:

\section*{Introduction}

Reactive programming refers to event-driven, concurrent, and user-controlled programs that process data as it arrives. It is widely used in digital electronics for design, testing, and implementation.

Finite state machines (FSM) are an efficient method of describing the behavior of a system, responding to events, running concurrently with other tasks, and responding to user events in a timely manner.

In FSMs, reactive programming can be seen as processing data as it arrives instead of waiting for user input. A finite state machine consists of a diagram that shows the states of the system and how they are changed by events. For example, the tap-on/tap-off table light changes from "off" to "on" when tapped once and then back to "off" after being tapped again.

\section*{Reactive Programming in FSMs}

Reactive programming allows us to process data as it arrives instead of waiting for user input, which is beneficial in digital electronics applications such as designing, testing, and implementing systems.

We can use Python scripts to extract the OCR output from the image file and merge it with the original LaTeX document. Here's an updated version of your Python code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```python
import subprocess
from PIL import Image

# Function to extract OCR from LaTeX
def extract_ocr(latex_equation):
    # Convert LaTeX equation to image
    latex_to_png = f"latex2image -d png {latex_equation}"
    subprocess.run(latex_to_png, shell=True)
    
    # Open the image file
    img_file = "temp.png"
    with open(img_file, 'rb') as f:
        img_data = f.read()
        
    # Apply OCR to the image
    import pytesseract
    ocr_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open(img_file))
    
    return ocr_text

# Function to combine LaTeX and OCR outputs
def combine_latex_ocr(latex_equation, ocr_text):
    combined_output = f"{latex_equation} {ocr_text}"
    return combined_output

# Example usage
latex_equation = r"$\boxed{10}$"
ocr_text = extract_ocr(latex_equation)
combined_output = combine_latex_ocr(latex_equation, ocr_text)

print(f"Original LaTeX: {latex_equation}")
print(f"Extracted OCR: {ocr_text}")
print(f"Combined Output: {combined_output}")
```

In this updated version of your Python code snippet, we first extract the OCR output from the image file using `pytesseract`. Then, we combine the original LaTeX equation with the extracted OCR text using a simple concatenation approach.

Finally, we can add the combined output to the existing document while preserving its integrity. We can use the following Python script to merge the OCR output with the LaTeX document:

```python
import subprocess

# Function to merge LaTeX and OCR outputs
def merge_latex_ocr(latex_equation, ocr_text):
    # Use LaTeX tool to combine LaTeX and OCR outputs
    latex_merge = f"\\text{latex_equation} \\text{{ocr_text}}"
    return latex_merge

# Example usage
latex_equation = r"$\boxed{10}$"
ocr_text = extract_ocr(latex_equation)
combined_output = merge_latex_ocr(latex_equation, ocr_text)

print(f"Combined Output: {combined_output}")
```

In this example, we use a LaTeX tool to combine the original LaTeX equation with the extracted OCR text. The resulting output is then printed to the console.

To add the image data to the existing document, we can use the following Python script:

```python
import subprocess

# Function to add image data to LaTeX document
def add_image_data(latex_document):
    # Use LaTeX tool to include image file
    latex_include = f"\\includegraphics{{image_file.png}}"
    return latex_include

# Example usage
latex_document = r"Your existing LaTeX document"
image_file = "your_image_file.png"
image_data = subprocess.run(f"latex2png -d png {latex_document}", shell=True)
add_image_to_latex = add_image_data(latex_document)

print(f"Added image data: {add_image_to_latex}")
```

In this example, we use a LaTeX tool to include the image file in the existing document. The resulting output is then printed to the console.

By using these Python scripts and LaTeX tools, you can merge the OCR output with the LaTeX document while preserving its integrity.
