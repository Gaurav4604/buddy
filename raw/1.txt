\section{Introduction}
The principle of mass conservation constrains the fluid density, as stated in $(4.1)$. This can be better displayed using Reynolds transport theorem with $F=\rho$ and ${\bf b}={\bf u}$ to expand the time derivative:

$$
\int_{V ( t )} \frac{\partial\rho( \mathbf{x}, t )} {\partial t} \, d V+\int_{A ( t )} \rho( \mathbf{x}, t ) \mathbf{u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \cdot\mathbf{n} \, d A \,=\, 0. \tag{42}
$$

This is a mass-balance statement between integrated density changes within $V ( t )$ and integrated motion of its surface $A(t)$.

However, this general equation may be difficult to use in practice because the motion and evolution of $V ( t )$ and $A ( t )$ are determined by the flow, which may be unknown.

To develop an integral equation that represents mass conservation for an arbitrarily moving control volume $V^{*} ( t )$ with surface $A^{*} ( t )$, $(4.2)$ must be modified to involve integrations over $V^{*} ( t )$ and $A^{*} ( t )$. The first step in this modification is to set $F=\rho$ in $(3.35)$ to obtain:

$$
\frac{d} {d t} \, \int_{V^{*} ( t )} \! \rho( {\bf x}, t ) d V-\! \int_{V^{*} ( t )} \, \frac{\partial\rho( {\bf x}, t )} {\partial t} d V-\! \int_{A^{*} ( t )} \! \rho( {\bf x}, t ) {\bf b} \cdot{\bf n} \, d A \,=\, 0.
$$

The second step is to choose the arbitrary control volume $V^{*} ( t )$ to be instantaneously coincident with material volume $V ( t )$, so that at the moment of interest $V ( t )=V^{*} ( t )$ and $A ( t )=A^{*} ( t )$. At this coincidence moment, the $(d/dt) \mathrm{pd}V-$terms in $(4.1)$ and $(4.3)$ are not equal; however, over $A ( t )$, the volume integration of $\partial\rho/ \partial t$ in $(4.2)$ is equal to that in $(4.3)$ and the surface integral of $\rho\mathbf{u}$ n
is equal to that over $A^{*}(t)$:

$$
\int_{V^{\prime} ( t )} \frac{\partial\rho( \mathbf x, t )} {\partial t} d V \,=\, \int_{V ( t )} \! \! \frac{\partial\rho( \mathbf x, t )} {\partial t} d V \,=\,-\int_{A ( t )} \! \! \rho( \mathbf x, t ) \mathbf{u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \cdot\mathbf{n} \, d A \,=\, -\int_{A^{*}(t)} \rho( \mathbf{x}, t ) {\bf u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \cdot{\bf n} \, d A.
$$

This equation can be simplified to:

$$
\frac{d} {d t} \, \int_{V^{*} ( t )} \! \rho( {\bf x}, t ) d V-\! \int_{A^{*}(t)} \! \rho( \mathbf{x}, t ) {\bf u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \cdot{\bf n} \, d A \,=\, 0.
$$

In particular, when ${\bf b}={\bf u}$,
the arbitrary control volume becomes a material volume and $(4.3)$ reduces to $(4.1)$.

The differential equation that represents mass conservation is obtained by applying Gauss' divergence theorem $(2.30)$ to the surface integration in $(4.2)$:

$$
\int_{V ( t )} \! \! \frac{\partial\rho( \mathbf{x}, t )} {\partial t} \, d V+\int_{A ( t )} \! \rho( \mathbf{x}, t ) \mathbf{u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \cdot\mathbf{n} \, d A \,=\, \int_{V ( t )} \! \! \left\{\frac{\partial\rho( \mathbf{x}, t )} {\partial t}+\nabla\! \cdot\! \left( \rho( \mathbf{x}, t ) \mathbf{u} ( \mathbf{x}, t ) \right) \right\} d V \,=\, 0.
$$
