\section*{Introduction}
The density in a horizontal flow $\mathbf{u} = U(y, z)\mathbf{e}_x$ is given by $\rho(\mathbf{x}, t) = f(x - Ut, y, z)$, where $f(x, y, z)$ is the density distribution at $t=0$. Is this flow incompressible?

\section*{Solution}
There are two ways to answer this question. First, consider (4.9) and evaluate $\frac{D\rho}{Dt}$, letting $\xi = x - Ut$:

$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\rho=\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+U\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\xi}\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial t}+U\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\xi}\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\xi}(-U)+U\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial\xi}(1)=0.
$$

Second, consider (4.10) and evaluate $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}$:

$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=\frac{\partial U(y, z)}{\partial x}+0+0=0.
$$

This is an incompressible flow, but the density may vary when $f$ is not constant.

\section*{Stream Functions}

Consider the steady form of the continuity equation (4.7):

$$
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=0
$$

The divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero (see Exercise 2.21), so $\rho\{\mathbf{u}\} \nabla$ will satisfy (4.11) when written as the curl of a vector potential $\Psi$:

$$
\Psi=\chi\nabla\psi
$$

Furthermore, $\rho\mathbf{u}=\nabla\chi\times\nabla\psi$, because the curl of any gradient is identically zero.

\section*{Streamlines}

Let $\chi=a, \psi=c$ in Figure 4.1 are the streamlines. The mass flux $\dot{m}$ through the surface $A$ bounded by the four stream surfaces (shown in gray in Figure 4.1) is calculated with area element $d A$, normal n (as shown), and Stokes' theorem.

Defining the mass flux $\dot{m}$ through $A$, and using Stokes' theorem produces:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{m} &= \int\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{n}\,d A = \int_{A}(\nabla\times\mathbf{\Psi})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,d A = \int_{C}\mathbf{\Psi}\cdot d\mathbf{s} = \int_{C}\chi\nabla\psi\cdot d\mathbf{s}\\
&=\int_{C}\chi d\psi\\
&= b(d-c)+a(c-d) = (b-a)(d-c).
\end{aligned}
$$
