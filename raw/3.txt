4. CONSERVATION LAWS
EXAMPLE 4.2

The density in a horizontal flow $\mathbf{u} = U(y, z)\mathbf{e}_x$ is given by $\rho(\mathbf{x}, t) = f(x - Ut, y, z)$, where $f\left( x, y, z \right)$ is the density distribution at $t=0$. Is this flow incompressible?

Solution

There are two ways to answer this question. First, consider (4.9) and evaluate $\frac{D\rho}{Dt}$, letting $\xi = x - Ut$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{D\rho} {D t} &= \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot\nabla\rho \\
&= \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial t} + U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial x} \\
&= \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} \frac{\partial\xi} {\partial t} + U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} \frac{\partial\xi} {\partial x} \\
&= \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} (-U) + U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} (1) \\
&= 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Second, consider (4.10) and evaluate $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}$:

$$
\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) ~=~ 0. \tag{4.11}
$$

The divergence of the curl $\mathrm{o f}$ any vector field is identically zero (see Exercise 2.21), so $\rho\mathbf{u}$ will satisfy (4.11) when written as the curl of a vector potential $\Psi$:

$$
\rho \mathbf{u} ~=~ \nabla \times \mathbf{\Psi}, \tag{4.12}
$$

for $\Psi$ which can be specified in terms of two scalar functions: $\Psi = \chi\nabla\psi.$  Putting this specification into (4.12) produces $\rho\mathbf{u}=\nabla\chi\times\nabla\psi,$ because the curl of any gradient is identically zero (see Exercise 2.22). Furthermore, $\nabla\chi$ is perpendicular to surfaces of constant $\nabla\psi$, and $\nabla\psi$ is perpendicular to surfaces of constant $\psi$. Therefore, three-dimensional streamlines are the intersections of the two stream surfaces, or stream functions in a three-dimensional flow.

The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Consider two members of each of the families of the two stream functions $\chi = a$, $\chi = b$, $\psi = c$, $\psi = d$. The intersections shown as darkened lines in Figure 4.1 are the streamlines. The mass flux $\dot{m}$ through the surface $A$ bounded by the four stream surfaces (shown in gray in Figure 4.1) is calculated with area element $dA$, normal $\mathbf{n}$ (as shown), and Stokes' theorem.

Defining the mass flux $\dot{m}$ through $A$, and using Stokes' theorem produces:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{m} &= \int\rho\mathbf{u} \cdot\mathbf{n} dA \\
&= \int_{A} (\nabla\times\mathbf{\Psi}) \cdot\mathbf{n} dA \\
&= \int_{C} \mathbf{\Psi} \cdot d\mathbf{s} \\
&= \int_{C} \chi\nabla\psi \cdot d\mathbf{s} \\
&= \int_{C} \chi d\psi \\
&= b(d-c) + a(c-d) \\
&= (b-a)(d-c).
\end{aligned}
