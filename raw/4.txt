\subsection{0.5.1 Alphabets}

An alphabet is a finite, non-empty set of symbols. It is conventional to use the Greek letter $\Sigma$ (sigma), to represent an alphabet. Some examples of common alphabets are:

1. $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$: The set of binary digits.
2. $\Sigma = \{A, B, \cdots, Z\}$: The set of uppercase Roman letters.
3. $\Sigma = \{N, E, S, W\}$: The set of compass-points.

\subsection{0.5.2 Strings}

A string is a finite sequence of symbols drawn from an alphabet. A string is also sometimes called a word. Some examples of strings are:

1. $100101$ is a string from the binary alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.
2. $THEORY$ is a string from the Roman alphabet $\Sigma = \{A, B, \cdots, Z\}$.
3. $SE$ is a string from the compass-points alphabet $\Sigma = \{N, E, S, W\}$.

\subsection{Empty String}

The empty string is a string with no symbols in it, usually denoted by the Greek letter $\epsilon$. Clearly, the empty string is a string that can be chosen from any alphabet.

\subsection{Length of String}

It is handy to classify strings by their length, the number of symbols in the string. The string $THEORY$ has a length of 6. The usual notation for the length of a string $s$ is $|s|$. Thus, $|THEORY| = 6$, $|1001| = 4$, and $|\epsilon| = 0$.

\subsection{Powers of an Alphabet}

We are often interested in the set of all strings of a certain length, say $k$, drawn from an alphabet $\Sigma$. This can be constructed by taking the Cartesian product, of $\Sigma$ with itself $k$ times: $\Sigma \times \Sigma \times \cdots \Sigma$. We can represent this symbolically, using exponential notation, as $\Sigma^k$.

Clearly, $\Sigma^0 = \{\epsilon\}$, for any alphabet $\Sigma$, because $\epsilon$ is the only string whose length is zero. For the alphabet $\Sigma = \{N, E, S, W\}$, we find:

$$
\Sigma^1 = \{\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{S}, \mathrm{W}\}
$$

$$
\Sigma^2 = \{\mathrm{N N}, \mathrm{N E}, \mathrm{N S}, \mathrm{N W}, \mathrm{E N}, \mathrm{E E}, \mathrm{E S}, \mathrm{E W}, \mathrm{S N}, \mathrm{S E}, \mathrm{S S}, \mathrm{S W}, \mathrm{W N}, \mathrm{W E}, \mathrm{W S}, \mathrm{W W}\}
$$

$\Sigma^3$, has 64 members, since it contains $4 \times 4 \times 4$ members.

The set of all strings that can be drawn from an alphabet is conventionally denoted, using the so-called Kleene star, by $\Sigma^*$, and of course has an infinite number of members. For the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$,

$$
\Sigma^* = \{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, \cdots\}
$$

Clearly, $\Sigma^* = \Sigma^0 \cup \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2 \cup \cdots$

Note that I've used the `article` class and the `geometry` package to set the margins. You can adjust these settings according to your needs.

Also, I've kept the original LaTeX formatting of the mathematical expressions. If you want to change this, please let me know.
