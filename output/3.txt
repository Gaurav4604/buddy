EXAMPLE 4.2
The density in a horizontal flow ${\mathbf u}=U ( y, z ) {\mathbf e}_{x}$ is given by $\rho( {\bf x}, \, t )=f ( x-U t, y, z ),$ where $f \! \left( x, y, z \right)$ is the density distribution at $t=0$ . Is this flow incompressible?

Solution

There are two ways to answer this question. First, consider (4.9) and evaluate $\frac{D \rho} {D t}$ .

Setting $\xi=x-U t$, we have:
$$
\frac{D \rho} {D t}=\frac{\partial\rho} {\partial t}+\mathbf{u} \cdot\nabla\rho=\frac{\partial\rho} {\partial t}+U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial x}=\frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} \frac{\partial\xi} {\partial t}+U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} \frac{\partial\xi} {\partial x}=\frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} (-U )+U \frac{\partial\rho} {\partial\xi} ( 1 )=0.
$$

Second, consider (4.10) and evaluate $\nabla\cdot{\bf u}$:

$$
\nabla\cdot{\bf u} ~=~ 0. \tag{4.11}
$$

The divergence of the curl o f any vector field is identically zero (see Exercise 2.21), so $\rho\mathbf{u}$ will satisfy (4.11) when written as the curl of a vector potential $\Psi$ :

$$
\rho\mathbf{u} ~=~ \nabla\times\mathbf{\Psi}, \tag{4.12}
$$

for $\Psi$ which can be specified in terms of two scalar functions: $\Psi=\chi\nabla\psi.$  Putting this specification into (4.12) produces $\rho\mathbf{u}=\nabla\chi\times\nabla\psi,$ because the curl of any gradient is identically zero (see Exercise 2.22). Furthermore, $\nabla\chi$ is perpendicular to surfaces of constant $\psi,$ so the mass flux $\chi,$ and surfaces of constant $\chi$ and constant $\psi$ . Therefore, three-dimensional streamlines are the intersections of the two stream surfaces, or stream functions in a three-dimensional flow.

The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Consider two members of each of the families of the two stream functions $\chi=a, \, \chi=b, \psi=c, \psi=d$ . The intersections shown as darkened lines in Figure 4.1 are the streamlines. The mass flux $\dot{m}$ through the surface $A$ bounded by the four stream surfaces (shown in gray in Figure 4.1) is calculated with area element $d A$ ,normal $\mathbf{n}$ (as shown), and Stokes' theorem.

Defining the mass flux $\dot{m}$ through $A,$ and using Stokes' theorem produces:

$$
\begin{aligned} {\dot{m}} & {{} \,=\, \int\rho\mathbf{u} \cdot\mathbf{n} \, d A \,=\, \int_{A} \, ( \nabla\times\mathbf{\Psi} ) \cdot\mathbf{n} \, d A \,=\, \int_{C} \mathbf{\Psi} \cdot d \mathbf{s} \,=\, \int_{C} \chi\nabla\psi\cdot d \mathbf{s} \,=\, \int_{C} \chi d \psi} \\ {} & {{} \,=\, b ( d-c )+a ( c-d ) \,=\, ( b-a ) ( d-c ).} \\ \end{aligned}
