EXAMPLE 4.2

The density in a horizontal flow u = U(y, z)x is given by p(x, t) = f(x — Ut,y,z), where f(x, y, Z) is
the density distribution at t = 0. Is this flow incompressible?

Solution

There are two ways to answer this question. First, consider (4.9) and evaluate ∂p/∂t, letting
x=x—Ut:

dρ/dt=dρ/dt=∂ρ/∂t+u∂ρ/∂x+v∂ρ/∂y+w∂ρ/∂z=0
∂ρ/∂t−U(∂ρ/∂x)=0.

Second, consider (4.10) and evaluate ∇⋅v:
∇⋅v=(∂u/∂x)+(∂v/∂y)+(∂w/∂z)=0.

In both cases, the result is zero. This is an incompressible flow, but the density may vary when f is
not constant.

4.3 STREAM FUNCTIONS

Consider the steady form of the continuity equation (4.7):
∇⋅(pv)=0. (4.11)

The divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero (see Exercise 2.21), so pv will
satisfy (4.11) when written as the curl of a vector potential W:

pv=∇×W, (4.12)

which can be specified in terms of two scalar functions: W = yVx - xVy. Putting this specification
for W into (4.12) produces pv = ∂/∂y (∂Wz/∂x - ∂Wx/∂z) - ∂/∂x (∂Wz/∂y - ∂Wy/∂z) + ∂/∂z (∂Wx/∂y - ∂Wy/∂x), because the curl of any gradient is identically zero
(see Exercise 2.22). Furthermore, ∂/∂x is perpendicular to surfaces of constant x, and ∂/∂y is
perpendicular to surfaces of constant y, so the mass flux pv = ∇×W will be parallel to
surfaces of constant y and constant y. Therefore, three-dimensional streamlines are the inter-
sections of the two stream surfaces, or stream functions in a three-dimensional flow.

The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Consider two members of each of the families of
the two stream functions y = 4, x = b, Y= c, wy =d. The intersections shown as darkened lines
in Figure 4.1 are the streamlines. The mass flux m through the surface A bounded by the four
stream surfaces (shown in gray in Figure 4.1) is calculated with area element dA, normal n (as
shown), and Stokes’ theorem.

Defining the mass flux m through A, and using Stokes’ theorem produces:

m= ∫∫(∇×W)⋅ndA = ∫∫i (∂Wz/∂x - ∂Wx/∂z)dx dy + ∫∫j (∂Wz/∂y - ∂Wy/∂z)dxdy + ∫∫k (∂Wx/∂y - ∂Wy/∂x)dxdy
= [widy - wydz]dxdy + [wdxdy - wdxdz]dxdy + [wdzdy - wdxdy]dxdy
