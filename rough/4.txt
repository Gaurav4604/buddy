EXAMPLE 4.2

The density in a horizontal flow u = U(y, z)ex is given by p(x, t) = f(x — Ut,y,z), where f(x, y, Z) is
the density distribution at t = 0. Is this flow incompressible?

Solution

There are two ways to answer this question. First, consider (4.9) and evaluate Dp/Dt, letting
&€&=x— Ut:

Dp 0p Op Op Op o0é Op 0&F = dp Op

De ap MM = apt ae = a at de ax = gg WF URED = 0
Second, consider (4.10) and evaluate V-u:
a
Vu = Uly,2) +0+0=0.
ox

In both cases, the result is zero. This is an incompressible flow, but the density may vary when f is
not constant.

4.3 STREAM FUNCTIONS

Consider the steady form of the continuity equation (4.7):
V-(pu) = 0. (4.11)

The divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero (see Exercise 2.21), so pu will
satisfy (4.11) when written as the curl of a vector potential W:

pu=VxW, (4.12)

which can be specified in terms of two scalar functions: W = yVy. Putting this specification
for W into (4.12) produces pu = Vx x Vy, because the curl of any gradient is identically zero
(see Exercise 2.22). Furthermore, Vx is perpendicular to surfaces of constant x, and Vy is
perpendicular to surfaces of constant y, so the mass flux pu = Vx x Vy will be parallel to
surfaces of constant y and constant y. Therefore, three-dimensional streamlines are the inter-
sections of the two stream surfaces, or stream functions in a three-dimensional flow.

The situation is illustrated in Figure 4.1. Consider two members of each of the families of
the two stream functions y = 4, x = b, Y= c, wy =d. The intersections shown as darkened lines
in Figure 4.1 are the streamlines. The mass flux m through the surface A bounded by the four
stream surfaces (shown in gray in Figure 4.1) is calculated with area element dA, normal n (as
shown), and Stokes’ theorem.

Defining the mass flux m through A, and using Stokes’ theorem produces:

m= [ownda = Je x W)-ndA = [vas = [was = [xa
