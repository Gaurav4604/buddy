        "question": "What does Δ̂(P, s_1 s_2 s_3 ⋅⋅ s_n) represent in the context of NFA processing?",
        "answer": "The function Δ̂(P, s_1 s_2 s_3 ⋅⋅ s_n) represents the final state set after processing a sequence of input symbols. It takes an initial state-set P and a string of input symbols as input, returning the updated state-set that the NFA can be in after consuming the entire input string. This allows the NFA to determine whether it accepts or rejects the input string based on its current state-set."
