        "question": "What does Δ̂(P, s_1 s_2 s_3 ⋅⋅ s_n) represent in the context of NFA processing?",
        "answer": "The function Δ̂(P, s_1 s_2 s_3 ⋅⋅ s_n) represents the final state set after processing a sequence of input symbols. It takes an initial state-set P and a string of input symbols as input, returning the updated state-set that the NFA can be in after consuming the entire input string. This allows the NFA to determine whether it accepts or rejects the input string based on its current state-set."

        "question": "What is a Deterministic Finite Automaton?",
        "answer": "A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is defined by several key components: it has a finite set of states, an input alphabet consisting of symbols that the automaton can process, a transition function that determines the next state based on the current state and the input symbol. Additionally, there is a single start state, and one or more accept states which determine if the input string is accepted by the automaton."

    {
        "question": "What is an NFA?",
        "answer": "A Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is a type of finite automaton that allows multiple possible states at any given time, enabling it to model complex behaviors more easily than Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs)."
