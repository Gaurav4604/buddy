Core issues:

1. In vector space, "non-dairy products" is often closer to "milk" than "meat," this is a fundamental flaw of vector embedding search because they're very lossy.
2. Splitting documents into smaller chunks disrupts coherence, breaking cross-references and context.
3. Adopting new RAG architectures, re-embedding chunks with new models, and rerankers requires continuous, costly data (re)engineering efforts.
4. No Support for Aggregations â€“ Vector search struggles with queries requiring

uses local models
